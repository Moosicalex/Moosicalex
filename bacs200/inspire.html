<p>What does it mean to be a good <strong>man?</strong> A good <strong>role model?</strong> Or even a good <strong>person?</strong></p>
<p>People will try and search for happiness for years and find nothing but pain. It's almost as if theres some kind of secret to being happy that only few know about and that is rarely shared.</p>
<p>I beleive Mr. Master Sergeant Robert Norman Ross knew the answer, and tried his best to tell us.</p>
<p>In his televisions show, <em>"The Joy Of Painting"</em>, Bob Ross provided more than just painting instructions. For many Mr. Ross provided a comfort in his kind demeanor, kind advice, and gentle voice. There were very few moments on his show in which Bob was unhappy or generally unwell. However, on the rare occasions that he was, he still assured us that "Gotta have opposites dark and light, light and dark in painting. It's like in life. Gotta have a little sadness once in a while so you know when the good times come."</p>
<p>From watching his show you might assume that Bob had an easy, almost monk-like, life. However, he faced as much adversity as the rest of us. Ross had a very successful military career. He started off as a medical records technician for the United States Airforce and quickly rose to the rank of master sergeant. In this position he was required to do things that he didn't agree with on a spiritual level. He had always been a very kind, comforting person who would take care of injured animals, he wasn't meant to be <em>"the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work,"</em> So when he got out of the military he swore to never raise his voice again. He wanted to be and strived to be kind and respectful, yet honest.</p>
<p>In 1992, three years before his death, Bob lost his wife to cancer. As a private man he never talked about his wifes death on the show, however, on one of the episodes recorded shortly after her death is when his afformentioned qupte about light and dark comes from, he follows it up with "I'm waiting on the good times now." Ross' best friend ,Kowolski, has mentioned in interviews how she knows bob would rehearse every word he would say on screen the next day, he would think about it all day and in bed. Bob knew his position as a rold model on his show and decided that others might be able to learn something from his terrible experiences.</p>
<p>In the end, Ross died at the age of 52 due to complications with lymphoma. His legacy is one of perserverance and happiness. He made every effort to the people of this world to let us learn and grow from his hardships and to share his happiness with everyone around him. Life's hard, but sometimes all you need is a kind voice and some <strong>happy trees.</strong></p>
